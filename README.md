# Share_price_maximising
This is a project to find the best times in the day to buy and sell shares.

##
This code is written in Main.Java.

The following are assumptions I have made :
* The share price cannot drop below 1 at any hour.
* If there is no maximum profit the algorithm will return 0.
* I am assuming the currency is NZD and that a share price will not be over 6 digits
* I am assuming the numbers are round numbers given I am receiving an integer array as opposed to a double.
