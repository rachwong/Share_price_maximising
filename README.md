# Share_price_maximising
This is a project to find the best times in the day to buy and sell shares.

##
This code is written in Java.

The following are assumptions I have made :
* The share price cannot drop below 0 at any hour.
* If there is no maximum profit the algorithm will return 0.
* If there are repeated numbers, take the first one in the day.
